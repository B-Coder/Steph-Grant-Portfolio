    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Steph and welcome to my page. Firstly I would like to thank you for taking the time to view my page and as a treat I'll tell you a little about myself. I recently decided to make a major change in my career and so I'm surrently learning to code. This is probably one of the biggest challenges or rather wall I've ever had to climb but I'm determined to reach the otherside. I'm also an avid gamer, anime lover and a weakness for tech (too much tech some might say)lol!
        As a person I believe in putting my best foot forward and so I make a effort to learn from today about the things I didn't know yesterday. I'm very much a family person and will do anythiing for othrs, as long as its in my power to do so.</p>
    <p>Since I've told you a little bit about myself and we've got better aquainted, why not take a look at the projects I'll be working on in the future below:</p>
